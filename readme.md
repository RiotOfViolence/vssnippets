# Code Snippets for Visual Studio.

This repo contains some code snippets for Visual Studio I found useful when coding. An example:

Type `nguid` and press tab twice and you will get:

```csharp
Guid.NewGuid()
```

Currently there are snippets for:
* Some commonly used methods (like `DateTime.Now` or `Guid.NewGuid()`) 
* Multiple commonly used NUnit methods (like assertions and test methods)
* Multiple commonly used Rhino.Mocks methods (like `Arg.Is.Anything` etc.)
* A `cr` pendant to `cw`!

Feel free to explore, use or contribute!

## To use:
 
1. Clone repo or download it as .zip
2. Open Visual Studio 2015/2017 (other Versions might work, have not tested)
3. Tools -> Code Snippets Manager
4. Press Import... and choose *.snippet file(s)
5. Confirm
